# Cross Model Experiment Results

## Annotation
- `filename`: The file is named as `<repaired_models>_<evaluation_models>`.
- `repair_models` indicate the models that repair the ambiguous requirements.
- `evaluation_models` indicate the models that sample and evaluate programs on the repaired requirement.

## Results
- `repaired_passk`: The pass@k of the repaired requirements on repair models.
- `cross_model_passk`: The pass@k of the repaired requirements on evaluation models.
- `original_passk`: The pass@k of the original requirements on repair models.
