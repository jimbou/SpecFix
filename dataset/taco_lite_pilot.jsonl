{"requirement": "def build_square(blocks):\n\"\"\"# The Invitation\n\nMost of us played with toy blocks growing up. It was fun and you learned stuff. So what else can you do but rise to the challenge when a 3-year old exclaims, \"Look, I made a square!\", then pointing to a pile of blocks, \"Can _you_ do it?\"\n\n# These Blocks\n\nJust to play along, of course we'll be viewing these blocks in two dimensions. Depth now being disregarded, it turns out the pile has four different sizes of block: `1x1`, `1x2`, `1x3`, and `1x4`. The smallest one represents the area of a square, the other three are rectangular, and all differ by their width. Integers matching these four widths are used to represent the blocks in the input.\n\n# This Square\n\nWell, the kid made a `4x4` square from this pile, so you'll have to match that. Noticing the way they fit together, you realize the structure must be built in fours rows, one row at a time, where the blocks must be placed horizontally. With the known types of block, there are five types of row you could build:\n\n* 1 four-unit block\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit bock (in either order)\n* 2 two-unit blocks\n* 1 two-unit block plus 2 one-unit blocks (in any order)\n* 4 one-unit blocks\n\nAmounts for all four of the block sizes in the pile will each vary from `0` to `16`. The total size of the pile will also vary from `0` to `16`. The order of rows is irrelevant. A valid square doesn't have to use up all the given blocks.\n\n# Some Examples\n\nGiven `1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2` there are many ways you could construct a square. Here are three possibilities, as described by their four rows:\n\n* 1 four-unit block\n* 2 two-unit blocks\n* 1 four-unit block\n* 4 one-unit blocks\n>\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block\n* 2 two-unit blocks\n* 1 four-unit block\n* 1 one-unit block plus 1 three-unit block\n>\n* 2 two-unit blocks\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block\n* 1 four-unit block\n* 2 one-unit blocks plus 1 two-unit block\n>\n\nGiven `1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2` there is no way to complete the task, as you could only build three rows of the correct length. The kid will not be impressed.\n\n* 2 two-unit blocks\n* 1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block\n* 1 four-unit block\n* (here only sadness)\n>\n\n# Input\n```python\nblocks ~ a random list of integers (1 <= x <= 4)\n```\n# Output\n```python\nTrue or False ~ whether you can build a square\n```\n# Enjoy!\n\nIf interested, I also have [this kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cb7baa989b1c50014a53333) as well as [this other kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cb5eb1f03c3ff4778402099) to consider solving.\n\"\"\"", "inputs": [[[]], [[2, 2, 1, 1, 2]], [[3, 3]], [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]], [[]], [[3, 2]], [[1, 1, 1]], [[2, 2, 1, 1]], [[]], [[]]], "outputs": [[true], [true], [false], [false], [true], [false], [false], [true], [true], [false]], "starter_code": "def build_square(blocks):", "canonical_solution": "def build_square(blocks):\n    for x in range(4):\n        if 4 in blocks:\n            blocks.remove(4)\n        elif 3 in blocks and 1 in blocks:\n            blocks.remove(3)\n            blocks.remove(1)\n        elif blocks.count(2) >= 2:\n            blocks.remove(2)\n            blocks.remove(2)\n        elif 2 in blocks and blocks.count(1) >= 2:\n            blocks.remove(2)\n            blocks.remove(1)\n            blocks.remove(1)\n        elif blocks.count(1) >= 4:\n            blocks.remove(1)\n            blocks.remove(1)\n            blocks.remove(1)\n            blocks.remove(1)\n        else:\n            return False\n    return True", "entry_point": "build_square", "task_id": "TACO_lite/46", "input_output_examples": [[[1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2], [1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2]], [[true], [false]]]}
