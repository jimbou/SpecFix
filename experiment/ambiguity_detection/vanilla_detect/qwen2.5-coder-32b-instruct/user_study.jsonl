However, it assumes all characters in the input string are lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'). There's no ambiguity in this part regarding the intended functionality.\n\n2. **Decoding Functionality**: The `decode_shift` function's description is less clear. It states that it should take a string encoded with `encode_shift` and return the decoded string. However, there are several potential ambiguities:\n   - **Character Set**: Similar to the encoding function, it is unclear if the decoding function should only handle lowercase letters. If the input string contains characters outside of 'a' to 'z', the behavior is undefined based on the provided description.\n   - **Handling Non-Alphabet Characters**: The `encode_shift` function does not account for non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation). The `decode_shift` function's behavior for these characters is ambiguous since they would not have been altered by `encode_shift`.\n   - **Edge Cases**: While the encoding function handles the wrap-around using modulo 26, the decoding function's behavior for characters shifted beyond 'a' (e.g., 'f' becoming 'a') is implicitly handled but not explicitly stated. For example, what should happen if the input string includes characters shifted outside the range of 'a' to 'z'? Since the encoding function only processes lowercase letters, this might not be an issue, but it's still ambiguous without explicit clarification.\n\n3. **Contradictions and Multiple Interpretations**: Given the above points, particularly the lack of clarity on handling non-lowercase characters and edge cases, the requirement leaves room for multiple reasonable interpretations of how the `decode_shift` function should behave.

These are potential edge cases that are not addressed, leading to ambiguity in how the function should behave.\n\n3. **Reversal Condition**: The requirement states that if `shift > number of digits`, the digits should be reversed. This introduces another layer of ambiguity because it's not clear why reversing the digits is the appropriate action when the shift exceeds the number of digits. It could be interpreted differently based on the context or intended use case.\n\n4. **Return Type**: The requirement specifies that the result should be returned as a string, which is clear. However, the behavior leading up to this return (i.e., how the digits are manipulated) is not fully detailed, especially concerning the reversal condition.\n\nGiven these points, the requirement leaves room for multiple reasonable interpretations and contains some contradictions or unclear elements, particularly regarding edge cases and the rationale behind reversing digits when the shift exceeds the number of digits. Therefore, the requirement is considered ambiguous."}

This creates ambiguity about the desired behavior in this edge case.\n   - **Single Element List**: While multiplying a single-element list is straightforward, the division by the length of the list (which would be 1) might seem redundant but is still defined. However, the requirement does not explicitly state how to handle this case, leaving some room for interpretation.\n   - **List with Zero**: The presence of zero in the list would make the product zero, and the final result after division would also be zero.

This part is relatively clear.\n\n2. **Week Definition**: On Earth, weeks are defined as 7 days (from Sunday to Saturday). However, on planet XY140Z-n, weeks are defined as `n + 1` days (from day 0 to day `n`). This introduces a new variable `n` which affects the length of the week.\n\n3. **Week Numbering**: The requirement states that savings occur from week number 0 to week number `n`. This means there are `n + 1` weeks of savings.\n\n4. **Saving Calculation**: The amount saved each day within a week is influenced by the week number. For example, in week 0, you save 1 on Monday (day 1), 2 on Tuesday (day 2), ..., up to `n` on day `n`. In week 1, you save 2 on day 1, 3 on day 2, ..., up to `n+1` on day `n`, and so on.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: \n   - **Minimum Value of n**: The requirement specifies `n > 0`, so the smallest value for `n` is 1. For `n=1`, there would be 2 days per week, and you would save 1 on day 1 of week 0 and 2 on day 1 of week 1.\n   - **Maximum Value of n**: There is no specified upper limit for `n`, so the function should theoretically handle very large values of `n`.\n\n**Ambiguity Points**:\n- **Day Numbering vs Week Numbering**: The requirement mentions both day numbers (0 to `n`) and week numbers (0 to `n`). It’s unclear if the savings calculation is affected by the week number beyond the daily increment.\n- **Total Savings Calculation**: The requirement does not explicitly state how the total savings are calculated across all weeks and days. It only provides a pattern without a clear summation formula.\n- **Inclusion of Days in Weeks**: It is not explicitly stated whether day 0 of each week is included in the savings (as it is described as saving \"nothing\" on Sunday on Earth, which might imply day 0 is not counted in savings).\n\nGiven these points, the requirement leaves room for multiple interpretations regarding the exact calculation of total savings, especially concerning how the week number influences daily savings and whether day 0 is included in the savings pattern.\n\nTherefore, the requirement is ambiguous."}

However, if there are two identical smallest numbers (like `-2` in this case), it's unclear whether the function should return the next distinct number or the same number again.

However, since the combs cannot be reversed, the overlap is limited to the number of matching teeth from the end of one comb to the start of the other.\n    - **Extreme Values**: The requirement specifies that the length of each comb is between 1 and 10, so the maximum possible length of the purse is 20 (if there is no overlap).\n\n4. **Example Provided**:\n    - The example given (`comb1 = \"*..*\"`, `comb2 = \"*.*\"`) and the accompanying images clarify how the combs should be placed and the expected minimum purse length (5).

This shows that with an even distribution, each server gets half the jobs.\n   - For `distribute(3, 3)`, the output is `[[0], [1], [2]]`. Here, the distribution is even, with each server getting one job.\n   - For `distribute(4, 10)`, the output is `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7], [8, 9]]`.

This example serves to illustrate the expected output and confirms that the problem is understood correctly.\n\n4. **Constraints**: The constraints `1<=n<=50` and `1<=k<=15` define the range of input values, which helps in understanding the scope of the problem and ensures that the solution is feasible within these limits.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: While specific edge cases are not explicitly mentioned, the problem inherently covers edge cases such as `n=1` (only one way to climb a single step) and `k=1` (only one way to climb regardless of `n`, by taking one step at a time). The example provided also includes scenarios that test different combinations of `n` and `k`.\n\n6. **Tip**: The tip suggests using Fibonacci numbers, which indicates a dynamic programming approach that is suitable for solving this type of combinatorial problem.

However, it does not clarify the starting character (vowel or consonant) for the sequence. This ambiguity can lead to different interpretations of what constitutes the \"lexicographically lowest\" result.\n   \n3. **Equal Number of Vowels and Consonants**: The requirement specifies that if the number of vowels and consonants are equal, the first letter of the result must be a vowel. While this is clear, it does not address scenarios where the number of vowels and consonants is not equal. Does the rule still apply, or should the function behave differently in such cases?\n   \n4. **Edge Cases with Extreme Values**: The requirement does not explicitly address how the function should handle strings with very few characters (e.g., a single character string) or strings composed entirely of vowels or consonants.
