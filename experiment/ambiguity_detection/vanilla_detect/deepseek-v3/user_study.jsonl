The original intention of Poohbear was to be able to send messages that would, to most, be completely indecipherable: \nPoohbear Wiki\n\n* For the purposes of this kata, you will make a version of Poohbear that has **infinite** memory cells in **both directions** (so you do not need to limit cells to 30,000)\n* Cells have a default value of 0\n* Each cell can hold one byte of data.  Once a cell's value goes above 255, it wraps around to 0.  If a cell's value goes below 0, it wraps to 255.\n* If the result of an operation isn't an int, round the result down to the nearest one.\n* Your interpreter should ignore any non-command characters in the code.\n* If you come to a `W` in the code and the current cell is equal to 0, jump to the corresponding `E`.\n* If you come to an `E` in the code and the current cell is **not** 0, jump back to the corresponding `W`.\n\nHere are the Poohbear commands: \n\n| Command | Definition\n|---| -------------------------\n| + | Add 1 to the current cell\n| - | Subtract 1 from the current cell\n| > | Move the cell pointer 1 space to the right\n| < | Move the cell pointer 1 space to the left\n| c | \"Copy\" the current cell\n| p | Paste the \"copied\" cell into the current cell\n| W | While loop - While the current cell is not equal to 0\n| E | Closing character for loops\n| P | Output the current cell's value as ascii\n| N | Output the current cell's value as an integer\n| T | Multiply the current cell by 2\n| Q | Square the current cell\n| U | Square root the current cell's value\n| L | Add 2 to the current cell\n| I | Subtract 2 from the current cell\n| V | Divide the current cell by 2\n| A | Add the copied value to the current cell's value\n| B | Subtract the copied value from the current cell's value\n| Y | Multiply the current cell's value by the copied value\n| D | Divide the current cell's value by the copied value.\n\"\"\"", "answer_without_examples": "Yes", "reason_without_examples": "1. **Infinite Memory Cells**: The requirement states that the Poohbear interpreter should have infinite memory cells in both directions. However, it does not specify how to handle the practical limitations of memory in a real-world implementation. This could lead to ambiguity in how to manage memory overflow or underflow in practice.\n\n2. **Cell Value Wrapping**: The requirement specifies that cell values should wrap around when they go above 255 or below 0. However, it does not clarify how to handle the rounding of non-integer results from operations like square root or division. This could lead to different interpretations of how to round down the results.\n\n3. **Copy and Paste Operations**: The requirement mentions \"copy\" and \"paste\" operations but does not define what happens if a cell is copied and then modified before pasting. This could lead to ambiguity in the expected behavior of these operations.\n\n4. **Loop Handling**: The requirement describes the behavior of `W` and `E` commands but does not specify how nested loops should be handled or what happens if there are unmatched `W` or `E` commands. This could lead to ambiguity in interpreting complex code structures.\n\n5. **Mathematical Operations**: The requirement includes operations like square root and division, which can produce non-integer results. It states that non-integer results should be rounded down to the nearest integer, but it does not specify how to handle edge cases like dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.\n\n6. **Output Commands**: The requirement specifies that `P` outputs the current cell's value as ASCII and `N` as an integer. However, it does not clarify how to handle non-printable ASCII characters or how to output values that are outside the valid ASCII range.\n\nIn summary, the requirement leaves room for multiple reasonable interpretations in several areas, including memory management, rounding of results, handling of loops, and edge cases in mathematical operations. Therefore, the requirement is ambiguous."}

The example given (`solve(\"codewars\") = \"failed\"`) suggests that the function should return \"failed\" in such cases, but this is not explicitly stated in the general description.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The requirement mentions that if the number of vowels and consonants are equal, the first letter of the result must be a vowel. However, it does not address what should happen if the number of vowels and consonants are not equal. For example, if there are more vowels than consonants, should the function still attempt to alternate them, or should it return \"failed\"? This ambiguity leaves room for multiple interpretations.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**: The requirement specifies that the function should return the lexicographically lowest element in the list of possible alternations. However, it does not provide a clear definition of how to generate this list, especially in cases where alternation is not straightforward.\n\n4. **Edge Cases with Extreme Values**: The requirement does not explicitly address how the function should handle edge cases, such as extremely long strings or strings with no vowels or consonants.
