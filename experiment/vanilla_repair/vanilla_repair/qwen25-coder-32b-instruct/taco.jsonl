It is exactly like our planet, but it has one difference:\n#The values of the digits 3 and 7 are twisted.\nOur 3 means 7 on the planet Twisted-3-7. And 7 means 3.\n\nYour task is to create a method, that can sort an array the way it would be sorted on Twisted-3-7.\n\n7 Examples from a friend from Twisted-3-7:\n```\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> [1,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,9]\n[12,13,14] -> [12,14,13]\n[9,2,4,7,3] -> [2,7,4,3,9]\n```\n\nThere is no need for a precheck. The array will always be not null and will always contain at least one number.\n\nYou should not modify the input array!\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!\n\"\"\"", "original_result": true, "ambiguous": "Yes", "reason": "1. **Clarification on Twisting Values**: The requirement states that the digit '3' is considered as '7' and vice versa on the planet Twisted-3-7. However, it is unclear whether this transformation applies only to single-digit numbers or to all occurrences of the digits within multi-digit numbers. For example, should the number 13 be treated as 17, or should the entire number be transformed in some way?\n\n2. **Sorting Logic**: The examples provided seem to suggest that the transformation involves replacing digits within numbers (e.g., 3 becomes 7 and 7 becomes 3), and then sorting the numbers based on these transformed values. However, there is no explicit statement confirming this logic. The transformation and sorting steps could be interpreted differently, leading to various implementations.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: While the requirement mentions that the input array will always be non-null and contain at least one number, it does not specify how to handle edge cases such as arrays with very large numbers or arrays with repeated numbers. The transformation rules and their impact on sorting behavior in these scenarios are not clearly defined.\n\nGiven these points, the requirement leaves room for multiple reasonable interpretations, particularly regarding the transformation of multi-digit numbers and the exact sorting logic based on these transformations. Therefore, the requirement is ambiguous.", "repaired_requirement": "def sort_twisted37(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"Sorts an array according to the rules of planet Twisted-3-7, where the digits 3 and 7 are swapped in value.\n    \n    For example:\n    - [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] is sorted as [1,2,7,4,5,6,3,8,9]\n    - [12,13,14] is sorted as [12,14,13]\n    - [9,2,4,7,3] is sorted as [2,7,4,3,9]\n\n    The input array will not be null and will contain at least one number.
