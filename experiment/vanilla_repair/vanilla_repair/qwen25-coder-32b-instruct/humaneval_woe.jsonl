In algebra, the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) dictates that exponentiation is done before multiplication and division, and these are done before addition and subtraction. However, since the operators are provided in a list, it could be interpreted that operations should be performed strictly in the order they appear in the list, ignoring the conventional precedence rules. This leaves room for multiple interpretations.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: While the requirement specifies that the operand list contains non-negative integers and that the operator list has at least one operator with the operand list having at least two operands, it does not explicitly address how the function should handle edge cases such as very large numbers or sequences of operations that could lead to integer overflow or floor division by zero. Although the latter might be considered invalid input, the question specifies to exclude considerations related to handling invalid inputs, so we must assume that such cases will not occur. However, the absence of explicit guidance on handling large numbers or sequences still introduces ambiguity.\n\n3. **Floor Division by Zero**: The requirement mentions floor division (//), but it does not clarify what should happen if there is a possibility of division by zero. Since the requirement excludes handling invalid inputs, we can assume that division by zero will not occur, but this is not explicitly stated, leaving some uncertainty.\n\n4. **Operator Precedence and Associativity**: The requirement does not specify the associativity of operators. For example, if the operator list contains multiple instances of the same operator (e.g., ['+', '+']), it is unclear whether the operations should be performed from left to right or right to left. Similarly, for operators with the same precedence (like multiplication and division), the requirement does not specify whether operations should be performed from left to right or right to left.\n\nGiven these points, the requirement leaves room for multiple reasonable interpretations, making it ambiguous.", "repaired_requirement": "def evaluate_expression(operators: List[str], operands: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Evaluate an algebraic expression constructed from a list of operators and a list of operands.\n    \n    Args:\n        operators (List[str]): A list of strings representing basic algebra operations: '+', '-', '*', '//', '**'.\n        operands (List[int]): A list of non-negative integers to be used as operands in the expression.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The result of evaluating the constructed algebraic expression.\n        \n    Note:\n        - The length of the operators list must be exactly one less than the length of the operands list.\n        - The operators list contains at least one operator.\n        - The operands list contains at least two operands.\n    \"\"\"", "repaired_result": false}
