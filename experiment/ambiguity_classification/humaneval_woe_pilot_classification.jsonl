The requirement specifies that the function `factorize` should return a list of prime factors of a given integer `n`, which seems clear at first glance.\n2. The phrase \"Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization\" suggests that if a prime factor appears multiple times in the factorization of `n`, it should also appear multiple times in the list. This seems to imply that the list should represent the full prime factorization, including repetition.\n3. The final sentence, \"Input number should be equal to the product of all factors,\" also aligns with the concept of prime factorization.\n4. However, the requirement lacks specific examples or edge case handling information, such as what should happen if `n` is 1 (since technically 1 has no prime factors), or how to handle non-positive integers.\n5. Furthermore, the requirement does not explicitly state that the input `n` must be a positive integer, allowing for potential confusion about the behavior with zero or negative numbers.\n6. There is a potential ambiguity in interpreting prime factorization when no constraints are provided on `n`, leading to multiple possible interpretations of the input conditions.\n\nGiven these missing pieces of information and lack of clarity on specific aspects of the input specification, the requirement can be interpreted in multiple ways, thus it is ambiguous."}

The requirement specifies the task clearly: \"From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\" This implies that the function should identify integers that appear multiple times in the list and remove all instances of such integers from the list.\n\n2.

The lack of clarification on why find_zero restricts to even-length lists with non-zero leading coefficients adds ambiguity.

The phrase \"efficiently compute the n-th element\" is somewhat subjective because it does not specify what constitutes an efficient implementation. An iterative approach might be implied because recursion is explicitly discouraged, but no further details are given about efficiency expectations (e.g., time complexity constraints).\n5. The requirement is mostly clear regarding how to calculate `fib4(n)` when `n >= 4`, but the lack of specific performance requirements means \"efficiently\" could be interpreted in multiple ways depending on different contexts or assumptions.\n6. Due to the lack of detailed specifications concerning efficiency and the undefined sequence name that might confuse the sequence's purpose, the requirement has ambiguous elements."}
{"requirement": "def median(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return median of elements in the list l.\"\"\"", "label": "Yes", "reasoning": "1. The requirement states \"Return median of elements in the list l.\"\n2. The term \"median\" might be straightforward to those familiar with statistics, but it can still result in ambiguity because it is not specified what should be done in certain situations.\n\n3. For example, the requirement does not address cases such as:\n   - What should be done if the list is empty? Should it return a specific value or raise an exception?\n   - When the list has an even number of elements, should the median be the average of the two middle numbers, or should it follow another method for calculating the median?\n   - Is there an assumption regarding the types of elements in the list (e.g., all numerical, can include strings, etc.)?\n\n4. The absence of this information means the code could be implemented in multiple valid ways depending on these interpretations.\n\n5. Due to these multiple interpretations and lack of specification, the requirement fits the criteria for being ambiguous."}
{"requirement": "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\"\"\"", "label": "Yes", "reasoning": "1. **Understanding the Requirement**: The requirement is to \"check if a given string is a palindrome\". A palindrome is typically defined as a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).\n\n2. **Elements of a Good Requirement**: A clear requirement should specify:\n   - Whether to consider spaces as part of the palindrome check.\n   - Whether to ignore capitalization (e.g., 'Aba' is typically considered a palindrome).\n   - Whether to ignore punctuation (e.g., 'A man, a plan, a canal, Panama' is a palindrome when ignoring punctuation).\n\n3. **Identifying Ambiguities**:\n   - **Spaces**: The requirement does not specify if spaces should be ignored or included.\n   - **Capitalization**: It is not clear if the check is case-sensitive or insensitive.\n   - **Punctuation**: There is no mentioned guideline for handling punctuation marks.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The requirement is ambiguous because it does not clarify details about case sensitivity, handling spaces, and punctuation, all of which can affect whether a string is considered a palindrome."}
{"requirement": "def modp(n: int, p: int):\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\"\"\"", "label": "Yes", "reasoning": "Step 1: Analyze the given requirement which is: \"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\"\nStep 2: Identify the key parts of the requirement: \n  - \"Return 2^n modulo p\": This instructs the function to calculate 2 raised to the power of n and then compute the result modulo p.\n  - \"(be aware of numerics)\": This phrase is vague and doesn't specify what the user should be aware of. It introduces ambiguity because it could refer to several aspects such as handling very large numbers, numerical overflow, precision issues with large integers, or performance concerns.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the potential interpretations:\n  - One interpretation could be a simple implementation of the calculation 2**n % p, focusing on correctness.\n  - Another interpretation could involve optimizing for large powers of n to avoid performance issues, perhaps using techniques like modular exponentiation.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the requirement can reasonably lead to different implementations or understandings due to its phrasing.\n  - The lack of specification on what \"be aware of numerics\" entails means developers could interpret the requirement differently, leading to variations in implementation strategy.\n\nStep 5: Conclude whether the requirement is ambiguous.\n  - Since there are multiple plausible approaches guided by individual interpretations of \"be aware of numerics,\" the requirement is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes,\" indicating that the requirement is indeed ambiguous."}
