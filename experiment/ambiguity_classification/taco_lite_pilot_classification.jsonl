{"question": "Given a number s (in string form). Find the smallest number (without leading zeros) which can be obtained by rearranging the digits of the given number.\n\n**Your Task:**\nYou don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `minimum_number()` which takes the number as an input parameter and returns the smallest number that can be formed without leading zeros by rearranging the digits of the number.\n\n**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N * log(N)) where N is the number of digits of the given number\n\n**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)\n\n**Constraints:**\n- 1 <= N <= 10<sup>5</sup>", "label": "No", "reasoning": "1. **Clear Objective**: The requirement clearly states the objective: to find the smallest number possible by rearranging the digits of an input number in string form, ensuring there are no leading zeros.\n\n2. **Conversion and Ordering**: The goal of minimizing a number by rearranging its digits is straightforward. It implies sorting the digits in ascending order and handling any special cases related to zeros.\n\n3. **Handling Leading Zeros**: The requirement specifically mentions that the resulting number must not have leading zeros. This suggests that there must be logic to move a non-zero digit to the front if zeros appear initially after sorting. This point is critical, and it is clearly addressed.\n\n4. **Function Specifics**: The requirement specifies the function `minimum_number()` and clearly describes what input it takes and what it should return. The role and limitations (not reading or printing anything) are clear and leave no room for alternative interpretations.\n\n5. **Complexity Constraints**: Both time and space complexity constraints are realistic and clear, given the upper limit on the length of the input number. The expected time complexity of O(N * log(N)) indicates the sorting process, which is logical for this task.\n\n6. **Constraints Clarity**: The constraint 1 <= N <= 10^5 ensures we are aware of the potential input size, permitting considerations for performance without tackling zero-length inputs or unexpected data types.\n\nOverall, the requirement is clear and specific with no apparent ambiguity. Both the goal and the constraints are well defined, leaving no alternate interpretations or missing information. Thus, the requirement is not ambiguous."}

It also mentions that anagrams are case insensitive, meaning that letter case should be ignored when determining if two words are anagrams.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Implementation**: The requirement does not explicitly state how to handle scenarios such as:\n   - The presence of spaces or special characters. Are they to be ignored or included when checking for anagrams?\n   - What constitutes a \"new word\"? Is it still an anagram if the words are the same, or must they be different entities?\n\n3. **Lack of Examples**: The requirement does not provide examples which can be critical in understanding edge cases. For instance, it's unclear whether two identical words, or words with repeated letters in different proportions, are considered valid anagrams.\n\n4. **Case Insensitivity**: While case insensitivity is noted, the requirement does not specify if this applies to all parts of handling the strings, such as sorting or comparing.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The requirement has multiple interpretations due to missing information on how special cases and specific input variations should be treated, leading to potential differences in implementation.\n\nBased on these observations, the requirement is indeed ambiguous."}

However, it doesn't specify whether the string can contain non-alphabetic characters and how those should be treated in calculating the smallest window.\n\n3. **Handling of Repeated Characters**: There's no clarification on how duplicate characters within the original string should be handled, whether they need only occur once in the window or match their frequency in the original string.\n\nDue to these reasons, and particularly the vague language regarding what constitutes \"all the characters\" of the string, the requirement leaves room for multiple interpretations.

It states that on each ith day, we are given the price, and we need to determine how to maximize profit by completing multiple transactions with the constraint that a new transaction can only be started after selling the current stock.\n\n2. **Identifying Clear and Ambiguous Parts**: \n   - The requirement clearly states that we can buy and sell stocks multiple times.\n   - It is explicitly mentioned that we cannot engage in a new transaction while holding a current stock, meaning there should be no overlapping trades.\n   - The fact that we need to complete the function `maximizeProfit()` and the function's expected input and output is stated clearly.\n   - The expected time complexity of O(n) aligns with this profit maximization problem typical greedy approach (e.g., buying whenever the next day stock price is higher).\n   - However, there is a note at the end querying if this can be solved in less space complexity, indicating room for improvement but not demanding an answer within the current request.

All necessary information to implement the function within the given constraints is available.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The requirement is specific and contains sufficient information to implement the function without ambiguity. Although it hints at potential optimization, it doesn't induce any uncertainty about how to solve the immediate problem within the stated time and space complexity.

Its primary task is to return the first letters of each word in a given string. This instruction is clear without ambiguity.\n\n2. **Case Sensitivity**: The requirement explicitly mentions that the first letters should be returned in uppercase. This provides a specific direction on how the function should handle the case of letters.\n\n3. **Input Type Handling**: If the input is not a string, the function should return 'Not a string'. This covers non-string arguments clearly.\n\n4. **Content Validity**: It specifies that if the string contains characters other than spaces and alphabet letters, the function should return 'Not letters'. While one might interpret \"spaces and alphabet letters\" as including only these characters, this phrase explicitly excludes other characters like numbers or punctuation, clarifying what is valid.\n\n5. **Empty Input**: In the case of an empty string, it is unambiguously stated that the function should return the string itself, `\"\"`.\n\n6. **Overall Interpretation**: The instructions are specific, covering different scenarios (input type, content validity, and edge cases like empty strings) with clearly defined outputs.

Your task is to complete the function `findMatchedWords()` which takes an array of strings `dict[]` consisting of the words in the dictionary and a string, `Pattern` and returns an array of strings consisting of all the words in the `dict[]` that match the given Pattern in lexicographical order.\n\nExpected Time Complexity: O(N*K) (where K is the length of the pattern).\n\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(N).\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= N <= 10", "label": "Yes", "reasoning": "1. **Understanding the Requirement**: The requirement states that there is a dictionary of words and a pattern. Each character in the pattern is uniquely mapped to a character in the dictionary. The task is to find words in the dictionary that match the pattern and return them in lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Identifying Potential Ambiguities**:\n   - The phrase \"Every character in the pattern is uniquely mapped to a character in the dictionary\" is potentially ambiguous. It is unclear whether it means that each character in the pattern maps to exactly one distinct character across all words, or if this mapping is word-specific.\n   - It is ambiguous whether the uniqueness of character mapping applies to each word individually or if the exact same mapping applies to the entire dictionary.\n   - There is no explicit mention if the words need to have a one-to-one character correspondence with the pattern, though it seems implied.\n\n3. **Assessing Completeness**: The requirement does not specify details such as the handling of non-applicable words, case sensitivity, or how to handle words that do not match the pattern length.\n\n4. **Expected Output**: The output criterion is to return the list of matching words in lexicographical order. While it is clear, some aspects of the matching criterion remain undefined due to the identified ambiguities.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The requirement has several ambiguities due to the unclear explanation of the character mapping from pattern to dictionary words, making multiple interpretations possible regarding exactly how the matching process should be carried out.\n\nThus, this requirement is indeed ambiguous."}
{"question": "Given a singly linked list, delete the middle of the linked list. If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, and you need to delete the second middle element. If the input linked list is NULL or has 1 node, then it should return NULL.\n\n**Your Task:**\nThe task is to complete the function `deleteMid()` which should delete the middle element from the linked list and return the head of the modified linked list. If the linked list is empty then it should return NULL.\n\n**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N).\n\n**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1).\n\n**Constraints:**\n- 1 <= N <= 1000\n- 1 <= value <= 1000", "label": "No", "reasoning": "1. **Requirement Overview:** The requirement specifies deleting the middle element from a singly linked list and provides clear instructions on how to determine the middle when there are two (by deleting the second middle element). It also outlines the behavior for edge cases such as a NULL list or a single node list.\n\n2. **Understanding Key Elements:**\n   - Identification of the \"middle\" element: If the list has an odd number of elements, there's a single middle element. If even, it specifies deleting the second of the two middle nodes.\n   - Special cases for empty (NULL) and single-node lists are clearly defined to return NULL.\n   - The requirement explicitly states the expected time complexity O(N) and space complexity O(1), which guides the approach.\n\n3. **Constraints:** The constraints are clearly specified, ensuring that the solution works within these bounds (1 <= N <= 1000, 1 <= value <= 1000). This means the implementation should handle up to 1000 nodes efficiently, as per the given complexity.\n\n4. **Evaluation of Ambiguity:**\n   - The requirement does not have vague definitions; the \"middle\" node and behavior for all cases are well specified.\n   - There are detailed instructions on handling edge cases.\n   - Both the expected time and space complexity targets are provided, guiding the implementation strategy without ambiguity.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** After reviewing all aspects of the requirement, it does not present multiple interpretations. The instruction to delete the \"second middle element\" in cases of even length linked lists is specific and leaves no room for ambiguity. The special conditions for NULL or single-node lists are expressly handled.\n\nTherefore, the requirement is precise and not ambiguous."}

This introduces a contradiction or perhaps an oversight.\n\n3. **Code Expectations**:\n   - The code should ideally implement logic to check if the sum is either a prime number or equal to one.\n   - If only the prime number condition is implemented, it conflicts with the requirement of also considering unity.\n\n4. **Vague/Contradictory Elements**:\n   - The requirement itself is potentially ambiguous because it mentions producing either a prime number or unity, yet it later focuses on only achieving a prime number for the sum.\n   - This could result in multiple valid interpretations: should the function try to make the sum equal to one, or should it only derive prime sums?\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Due to the contradiction regarding \"prime number or unity,\" the requirement is ambiguous. It is unclear whether unity should be a required outcome alongside prime numbers."}

In programming, this typically means converting the binary number in string format to an integer using standard functions, so there is no ambiguity here.\n   - **Modulus operation**: The requirement specifies the operation `r = k % m`.

The terms used in the requirement, such as \"largest integer exponent\" and \"evenly divides\", are mathematically defined and leave little room for various interpretations.\n- The requirement does not specify how to handle `n` when it takes certain values (like negative numbers), but typically for this type of mathematical function, the focus is on the divisibility aspect, and there is no ambiguity stated about `n` itself in the requirement.\n\nStep 4: Determine if there's any unclear wording or instructions.\n- The requirement uses straightforward and specific wording. It clearly defines the function's behavior and expected output for specific inputs without any vague or unspecified relationships.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the requirement is clear, specific, and does not contain ambiguities."}
{"question": "You are given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates. Your task is to return all possible subsets. Return only unique subsets and they can be in any order.\n\nYour Task:\nComplete the function vector> printuniquesubset(), which takes a vector nums and return a vector of vector consisting of all unique subsets.\n\nExpected Time Complexity: O(K2^{N}).\n\nExpected Auxiliary Space: O(K2^{N}).\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= nums.length <= 10\n-10 <= nums[i] <= 10", "label": "Yes", "reasoning": "1. **Interpreting the Requirement:** The requirement asks for the generation of all possible subsets from an integer array `nums`, with the condition that only unique subsets should be returned. It also mentions that duplicates may be present in the array, implying that the same elements in different orders should be considered as the same subset.\n\n2. **Potential Ambiguity:** The requirement is ambiguous primarily due to the lack of precise instructions on how to handle duplicates within the input array. Specifically, it's unclear if the array can contain repeated numbers and how those should be treated in terms of generating unique subsets. For instance, if the input array contains duplicates, it is not explicitly mentioned if those duplicates should be completely ignored beyond ensuring uniqueness in the output.\n\n3. **Uncertain Definitions:** The requirement lacks clarity on what exactly constitutes a \"unique subset\". It does not explicitly state whether the uniqueness should consider only the presence of elements or also the frequency of elements (e.g., should [1,2] and [1,1,2] be considered different subsets if the input contained [1,1,2]).\n\n4. **Potential Misinterpretations:** Without a clear definition of \"unique subsets,\" different interpretations arise. For example, should subsets be unique in terms of element combinations only, or should they also consider the occurrences of each element? This ambiguity directly affects how duplicates in `nums` are handled.\n\n5. **Complexity and Space Clarification:** While the requirement provides expected time and space complexities, it assumes a clear understanding of how duplicates affect subset generation, which is not sufficiently addressed.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The instructions are sufficiently ambiguous due to the missing details about the treatment of duplicates and the unique subset definition. Thus, one could interpret the requirement in more than one way."}
{"question": "We need a function that receives two integers, `a` and `b`, which define an inclusive range `[a, b]`. The function should return a sorted list of all numbers within this range that satisfy the property where the sum of each digit raised to the power of its position is equal to the number itself. If no such numbers exist within the range, the function should return an empty list.", "label": "Yes", "reasoning": "1. **Understanding the Requirement:** The requirement specifies a function that takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and returns a sorted list of numbers within the inclusive range `[a, b]`. These numbers must meet the condition where the sum of each digit raised to the power of its position is equal to the number itself.\n\n2. **Analyzing Clarity:** \n   - The requirement involves a mathematical property that needs careful interpretation: \"the sum of each digit raised to the power of its position is equal to the number itself.\" This could be understood differently depending on whether the counting starts from the left or right. \n   - For instance, if we take the number 123:\n     - From left to right: \\(1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 4 + 27 = 32\\).\n     - From right to left: \\(3^1 + 2^2 + 1^3 = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8\\).\n   - The requirement does not specify whether the \"position\" is counted from left to right or right to left. This crucial detail can lead to different interpretations.\n\n3. **Considering Edge Cases:**\n   - The requirement mentions returning an empty list if no such numbers exist, but it does not specify what should happen if `a` is greater than `b`, which is also a potential source of ambiguity.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Because the requirement does not clearly specify how to interpret the \"position\" of digits (left-to-right or right-to-left) and does not handle the case when `a > b`, it is ambiguous. These missing pieces of information can lead to multiple valid interpretations of the requirement."}

The task is to remove all duplicate characters from `Str` while maintaining the original order of characters. The result should be a string with unique characters in the original sequence.\n\n2. **Assessing Ambiguity**: \n   - *String Input*: The requirement states that the string may contain lowercase and uppercase characters. There is no mention of interpreting uppercase and lowercase as equivalent (e.g., \"A\" and \"a\" are different). This implies that the characters should be taken as distinct based on their case. \n   - *Output Order*: It clearly specifies that the order of characters in the resultant string should be the same as in the original. This eliminates any ambiguity regarding the ordering of characters.\n   - *Function Output*: The task is clear that the function should return the resultant string and there is no mention of printing anything, which removes ambiguity regarding I/O operations.\n   - *Complexity Requirements*: The expected time complexity O(N) and space complexity O(N) give a clear expectation of performance, aligning with an approach that allows for linear processing in terms of string length N.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The requirement provides clear details regarding operations on the string (handling uppercase and lowercase distinctly, maintaining order), input and output specifications, and performance expectations. There are no terms that suggest multiple interpretations or instructions with missing elements.\n\nSince the points above demonstrate a clear and unambiguous guideline, the requirement can be implemented as intended without leading to different interpretations."}

This implies that the entire border/perimeter of the subsquare is 'X'.\n\n2. **Interpretation of \"Surrounded by X\"**: The phrase \"surrounded by X\" could mean:\n   - The subsquare has 'X's only on the outer boundaries, and not necessarily forming a solid block of 'X's inside.\n   - The subsquare is entirely filled with 'X's, meaning every element within the boundaries is also 'X'.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Detection**: The absence of a clear definition for \"surrounded by X\" leads to multiple interpretations. Specifically, without additional context or a more precise definition, it's unclear whether the interior of the subsquare could contain 'O's or must be entirely 'X's.\n\n4. **Example Scenarios**: Consider these scenarios to highlight ambiguity:\n   - A 3x3 subsquare with the top, bottom, left, and right edges as 'X', but the center is 'O'. Is this valid?\n   - A completely filled 3x3 'X' subsquare. Is this the only valid configuration?\n\n5. **Implementation Impact**: The interpretation affects the implementation strategy:\n   - If only the perimeter needs 'X's, the approach might look for largest enclosing 'X' borders.\n   - If the entire subsquare requires 'X's, the solution would focus on identifying continuous blocks of 'X's.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Due to the crucial role the definition of \"surrounded by X\" plays in determining the size and structure of the subsquare, the requirement as written is ambiguous without additional clarification.\n\nTherefore, due to the potential multiple interpretations of what constitutes being surrounded by 'X', the requirement is ambiguous."}

The requirement specifies creating a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arrays and returns a single array by alternately appending elements from the passed arguments. This part is clear in intention.\n2. However, the ambiguity arises in how to pad the resulting array when the arrays are of unequal lengths.\n3. In the first block (`if-not:ruby`), the requirement states that padding should be done with \"empty elements.\" The term \"empty elements\" is ambiguous because it's unclear what type of empty elements should be used (e.g., empty strings, empty arrays, `None`, etc.).\n4. In the second block for Ruby (`if:ruby`), the requirement specifies padding with `nil`s, which is specific and clear for Ruby.\n5. The difference in padding specification between `if-not:ruby` and `if:ruby` implies that the requirement can be interpreted differently based on the language or further clarification of what \"empty elements\" mean is missing in the first block.\n6.

{"question": "Imagine there's a big cube consisting of n³ small cubes. Calculate, how many small cubes are not visible from outside.", "label": "Yes", "reasoning": "1. **Understanding the Requirement**: The requirement asks to calculate the number of small cubes in a larger cube that are not visible from the outside. This implies those cubes are covered by other cubes on all visible sides.\n\n2. **Breakdown**: For a 3D structure like a cube, \"visible\" typically means the cubes that are on the surface of the big cube. Therefore, \"not visible\" would refer to cubes that are completely surrounded by other cubes.\n\n3. **Potential Ambiguities**: \n    - The requirement uses the term \"not visible from outside\" without providing an explicit definition of what \"visible\" means in this context.\n    - There is no clarification on whether the cube is hollow or solid.\n    - The requirement does not specify if all layers included in the outermost layer are visible or only those that are literally on the outside face of the cube.\n\n4. **Clarifications Needed**: \n    - Define what constitutes the outside.
